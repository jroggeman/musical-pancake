I love autogenerated github repo names

## Setup
After cloning, enter virtual environment:

    source venv/bin/activate

and then install any dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you add any dependencies via pip, make sure to save them and commit the new
requirements file:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

When you're finished working, make sure to `deactivate`.

## Tests
Currently have tests in their own package, which makes it pretty straightforward
to run them without obnoxious imports.  Running

    python -m unittest test.test_hello

runs the `test/test_hello.py` file, but runs from the root directory, so imports
are easy.  Running

    python -m unittest discover

finds and runs all tests of the format `test_*.py`, which I figured would be
common, so I put that in a small script to save typing: `./run_tests`.
